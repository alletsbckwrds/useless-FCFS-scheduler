# useless-FCFS-scheduler
an FCFS scheduler. not really that useful, but it's kinda neat
<br/>
Note, the program is, again, half in italian, because it was a school project. maybe in the future i'll translate it.
<br/><br/>
<h2>C?</h2>
This program is technically C++, but only because i used cin/cout.. except for that it's mostly C...
<h2>How to compile:</h2>
<code>g++ -fpermissive ./FCFS.cpp -o ./FCFS</code>
